Let's discuss the problem of multivariate classification. "Multivariate" means that we have more than one input variable, and we will 
consider the interaction between the input variables when we classify them. For simplicity, we assume we have two input variables, x and y. For
this two-dimensional case, we can plot the data graphically. Let's say we have two classes; we will represent them with blue squares and red circles.
